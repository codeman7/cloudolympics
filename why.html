Why do we ask those specific questions?
</h1>
<p class="content">
Let me first state that every question is there for a reason and it is to help you have the best possible time on the site.
</p>
<h2 class="subhead">
Basic
</h2>
<p class="content">Both of the basic questions are there just for login information we will never sell your email to any companies its strictly for login information.
</p>
<h2 class="subhead">
Gaming
</h2>
<p class="content">
We ask for your Xbox gamertag to once you connect on the site you can find that person on Xbox and if you find someone on Xbox you can connect with them on the site.<br>
<br>
We ask what your favorite game is so that you can find people on the site that like the same games you like instead of pairing you up with someone that has all the same interest but plays a different game than you play.
</p>
